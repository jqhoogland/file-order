# Obsidian File Tree Alternative Plugin

This Obsidian Plugin allows users to change the order of their files (and to infer order from metadata).

It's based on the [alternate file tree plugin](https://github.com/ozntel/file-tree-alternative) by Ozan Tellioglu.

## Plugin Features

This plugin introduces an alternative view for displaying your files. It orders files by an `order` field in the metadata.
